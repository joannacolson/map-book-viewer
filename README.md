# u2-project-map-book-viewer
Unit 2 Project - A full-stack app that displays a user's contact info visually using the Google Maps API

# User Stories

1. As a user, when going to the site, I will see a page that lets me sign up or login using a local auth or a FaceBook auth capability.

2. As a user, I can not use the site unless I am logged in. When logged in, I can only access my data on the site, not other user's data.

3. As a user, I can create, read, update and delete Subjects to the site, such as 'My Friends' or 'Mexican Restaurants'.

4. As a user, for each Subject, I can create, read, update and delete Contacts, such as the name and address of specific friends or restaurants.

5. As a user, for a specific Subject, I can view a map with markers for each Contact within that Subject, such as a 'Mexican Restaurant' map with markers for each restaurant.

6. As a user, when displaying information about a Contact, it displays a Street View for the Contact's address.
